# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jannick SchrÃ¶er

**Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich**, specializing in Visual & Interactive Computing. Iâ€™m passionate about **Gaussian Splatting**, AR/VR, and robotics simulation. My work combines 3D reconstruction, real-time rendering, and simulation-driven system design.

## ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Working On

- **Gaussian Splatting for Robotics Simulation**
  - Applying cutting-edge rendering techniques to simulate high-fidelity robotic environments.
  - Integrating RGB-D and point-cloud data via ROS 2 + Gazebo to evaluate perception pipelines.

## ðŸ’» Featured Projects

### **QEDâ€‘Splatter**  
*Quickâ€‘Easyâ€‘Depth Splatting* â€“ My bachelor thesis project on 3D reconstruction of forest environments using Gaussian Splatting. Achieved top-grade evaluation (6/6) and is now cited in publications and extended by multiple ETH RSL projects.

### **Surfâ€‘Leaf**  
A group project from ETH CVG that builds on QEDâ€‘Splatter, designed as a mesh extraction pipeline from Gaussianâ€‘based reconstruction in urban environments.
